        <h2 style="text-align:left; color:grey; margin: 50px;">About Me</h2>
        
        <p style="font-size:14px; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px"> Hello there! My name is Sangeetha, I studied computer science in my undergraduate and worked as a software Engineer for a couple of years. With my computer science background and work experience, I now look forward to having a career in Data Science. I trust a career in Data Science is need of the time, intellectually challenging, and equally rewarding. I aspire to make a significant contribution to ongoing research projects which will have a greater impact on all components of the society.</p>
        <h1 style="font-size:14px; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px;color:grey"> Why I Chose Data Science?</h1>
        <p style="font-size:14px; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px"> I worked on a project to find underground water to dig borewells. 70% of Indian agriculture is dependent
        on underground water. Our project's main goal was to help find the underground water to improve agriculture in a relatively dry district in India. This project emphasized on how data science can find solutions to the problems at grass roots and drove me in the direction to pursue data science.</p>
        <h1 style="font-size:14px; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px;color:grey"> A little background:</h1>
        <p style="font-size:14px; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px"> I graduated from Visweraya technological University in Bachelor of Engineering in Information science and technology. I worked as a full stack web developer for two years and then as an analyst in different organizations.
            I was part of a no plastic campaign in the organization I worked for, and I was the head of the campaign. The main goal was to create awareness on harmful effects of plastic and reduce the use of single-use plastic.<br>
            I wrote a paper on Sentiment Analysis on Engish text and emoticons using varios mahine learning techniques. I also wrote a paper on the use of machine learning techniques to predict the number of visitors to a website. I worked on a project to build an automated attendance system for the classrooms to our university, that captured images of students in the class room
            and compared it with the images of students in the database to mark their attendance using image processing and machine learning.<br>
           I have campaigned for a female candidate in District council elections in a rural district of India. It was both challenging and inspiring to head a campaign. I decided to involve mself in this campaign to create awareness of basic rights in women and girls in rural areas of India. I was able to reach out to a lot of people and create awareness on the importance of women rights, education and health.
        </p>
        <h1 style="font-size:14px; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px;color:grey"> About my Work:</h1>
        <p style="font-size:14px; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px"> I worked as a full stack developer at an organization and we migrated a huge application for an insurance company from java and sql to ReactJs and MongoDb. My main responsibility was to design, and maintain the application while participating in code reviews to verify if the requirement specifications have been met.
        I worked as an analyst for a very brief period for a pharmaceutical consultancy, where we analysed their data and their competitor's data to come up with a solutiona and business plan to help increase the sales of the drugs to pharmacies, hospitals and insurance companies. </p>
        <h1 style="font-size:14px; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px;color:grey"> My Interests:</h1>
        <p style="font-size:14px; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px">In my free time I enjoy watching cricket, tv shows and web series. I watch almost all genre except horror. I really enjoyed watching Game of Thrones, it has been my favorite show, and now it's spin off House of the Dragon. I also enjoy watching sitcoms and have watched almost all of them. Apart from that I dance a little as a hobby. </p>
        <h1 style="font-size:14px; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px;color:grey"> Academic Interests</h1>
        <p style="font-size:14px; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px">I studied Computer Science in my Under graduation and I am intrigued by the concepts of computer networks, data stuctues and algorithms, Analysis of algorithms, Cyber Security and Machine Learning. After I started working in big MNC's I was facinated by the amout of data they deal with and all the things they do with that data. Thus, big data, Data Science and Analytics became my area of interest.
          Now, i look forward to utilize my programming skills to learn new concepts of Data Science and Engineering. I am excited to learn new concepts and apply them to solve real world problems.
        </p>

      <h1 style="font-size:14px; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px;color:grey"> Education </h1>
      <p style="font-size:14px; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px"> I took up physics, chemistry, Math and Biology as my major in highschool. After securing an A in my highschool I decided to change course to computer science and took up Information Science and Technology in my Bachelors. I secured an overall of 3.75 CGPA in my under graduation. I studied variuos progarmming languages like Java, JavaScript, Python, C, C++. I was also trained in MERN stack development during my internship with Infosys. </p>
